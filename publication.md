    description: CTSN is a novel learning method to predict the cloth deformation for skeleton-based characters with a two-stream network. The characters processed are not limited to humans, and can be other skeletal-based representations of non-human targets such as fish or pets.

    level: (EG2022)
    description: N-Cloth is a novel mesh-based learning approach for plausible 3D cloth deformation prediction. N-Cloth can handle cloth or obstacles represented by triangle meshes with arbitrary topologies. Graph convolution is used to transform the cloth and object meshes into a latent space to reduce the non-linearity in the mesh space.

    level: (Renewable Energy)
    description: A heat transfer model based on plastic deformation was constructed in the EDEM by discrete element method at the grain scale. The prediction performance of the model was validated by comparing the temperature evolution in simulation with the experimental values.
